Hate Speech Detection
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can detect and classify hate speech in text. The goal is to create a system that can automatically identify harmful or offensive language in online content, helping to prevent the spread of hate speech and ensure a safer digital environment.
Data Collection: Gathering a labeled dataset containing examples of hate speech and non-hate speech. These datasets often include various categories such as racial, religious, or gender-based hate speech.
Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data by removing stop words, normalizing text (e.g., converting to lowercase), and handling special characters. Tokenization and vectorization techniques (like TF-IDF or Word2Vec) are also used to convert text into numerical form for model input.
Feature Engineering: Extracting important features from the text such as word frequency, sentiment, or context, which help the model understand the structure and meaning of the content.
Modeling: Using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) to train a classifier that can differentiate between hate speech and non-hate speech.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are used to ensure the model generalizes well on unseen data.
Deployment: Integrating the model into applications like social media platforms, chatbots, or forums to flag harmful content and protect users from offensive language.
